                    I saw her today at the reception 
                    A glass of wine in her hand 
                    I knew she would meet her connection

                    And I went down to the demonstration 
                    To get my fair share of abuse 
                    Singing, "We're gonna vent our frustration 
                    If we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse"

                    I went down to the Chelsea drugstore 
                    To get your prescription filled 
                    I was standing in line with Mr. Jimmy 
                    And man, did he look pretty ill 
                    We decided that we would have a soda 
                    My favorite flavor, cherry red 
                    I sung my song to Mr. Jimmy 
                    Yeah, and he said one word to me, and that was "dead" 
                    I said to him 
                </p>

                    I saw her today at the reception 
                    In her glass was a bleeding man 
                    She was practiced at the art of deception 
                    Well I could tell by her blood-stained hands
